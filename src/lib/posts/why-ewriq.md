### **Where I'm From, My Age, and What I Do**

I am a 17-year-old from Gaziantep, Turkey, with a deep-seated passion for software development that has been a driving force in my life since I was 15. My journey into the world of technology began with an early fascination for computers, IT, and electronics. This curiosity has since blossomed into a focused pursuit of backend development, where I immerse myself in technologies like Node.js, Go, SQLite, and MongoDB.

My fascination with software is more than just a hobby; it feels like a fundamental part of who I am, and I envision a future where it plays a central role. Looking ahead, I have ambitious plans to study engineering or to contribute my skills to innovative companies like Google.

While my primary focus is on backend development, I also enjoy unwinding and exploring new creative avenues by working on various side projects. This allows me to experiment with different technologies and broaden my skill set.

I almost forgot to properly introduce myself! My name is Birol, and you can connect with me through my social media channels:
